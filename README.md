# Arduino L9110 Fan Motor

Arduino library for an L9110 Fan Motor. The software is tested on the following boards:

* Arduino Nano
* ESP32 DEVKIT V1

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Wiring

The pins need to be able to generate an PWM signal. On an Arduino Nano pins 5 and 6 can be used.

### Installing

Clone the repository, copy the `ArduinoL9110FanMotor` map in the Arduino libraries map (default path: `C:\Users\\[name]\Documents\Arduino\libraries`). For testing, you can navigate to the `examples` map and an example.
